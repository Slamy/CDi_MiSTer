# CDi_MiSTer

A project dedicated to create an FPGA implementation of the Philips CD-i to be usable for the MiSTer FPGA project.
As every Philips CD-i player has a different hardware, this project focuses on reverse engineering the "Mono I" PCB.
This mainboard is used in models like the 210/00, 210/05 or 220/20.

Most games which only utilize the hardware of a CD-i should work as expected.
Titles which require the Digital Video Cartridge will **NOT** work as the required hardware doesn't exist yet.
The RAM expansion of the DVC is included and will enhance some games.

## Usage

Place `cdi200.rom` as `boot0.rom` in `/media/fat/games/CD-i`.
Place `zx405042p__cdi_slave_2.0__b43t__zzmk9213.mc68hc705c8a_withtestrom.7206` as `boot1.rom` next to it.

Save files are stored inside an 8K NvRAM. MiSTer will create one save file per CD.
Whenever the NvRAM state changes, the "User" LED will light up, indicating
a change is queued to store. When the OSD is opened, the NvRAM will be flushed to SD card.

The save files containing the NvRAM are compatible with the CD-i emulation of MAME.

Digital gamepads, Analog gamepads and mice are supported for use with this core.
To play a title, load a CD and press on the play button at the start screen.
CD images can be stored as CHD or CUE/BIN format.

## Troubleshooting

* My NTSC CRT television set is not getting a stable image
  *  Please switch the core to NTSC and reset via OSD. This should fix the problem.

## Status

Core Utilization:

    Logic utilization (in ALMs)  13,513 / 41,910 ( 32 % )
    Total registers              15630
    Total block memory bits      630,471 / 5,662,720 ( 11 % )
    Total DSP Blocks             66 / 112 ( 59 % )

### TODOs in order of priority

* Find a better solution for reducing CPU speed
* Find a better solution for CD data stalling (take a screenshot or plug in a USB device)
    * PSX core seems to halt the whole machine to avoid this situation
* Fix regression: Audio hiccups during Philips Logo in Burn:Cycle
    * A workaround is CPU overclocking
* Investigate input responsiveness (skipped events?)
* Investigate screeching sound effect in the menu of "Golf Tips"
* Fix hang on audio track stop or change in media player
* Cheat support?
* Digital Video Cartridge MPEG Decoder
* Investigate "Gray border glitch" at the top of "Myst" gameplay (seems to be only one plane)
* Fix reset behaviour (Core is sometimes hanging after reset)
* Investigate desaturated colors / low contrast in "Photo CD Sample Disc"
    * Probably fixable with 16-235 to 0-255 scaling
    * More investigation needed
* Find a solution for the video mode reset during system resets
    * The ST flag is the issue here, causing a video mode change
* Add SNAC support (IR remote + wired controller)
    * RC5 support is added. A test using real hardware is required.
* CD+G
* Possibly adding support for other PCBs (like Mono II)
* Refurbish I2C for the front display and show the content as picture in picture during changes?
    * It might not even be required at all.

### Issues with external dependencies

* A dump of the SLAVE 3.2 ROM is required to fix some hacks
    * I2C front panel data is not correctly handled (e.g. Play button)

## Expected checksums of roms

This core is tested with these ROMs:

    2969341396aa61e0143dc2351aaa6ef6  cdi200.rom
    3d20cf7550f1b723158b42a1fd5bac62  zx405042p__cdi_slave_2.0__b43t__zzmk9213.mc68hc705c8a_withtestrom.7206

Due to legal reasons, these files must be sourced separately.

## Used resources

This MiSTer core would've probably never been possible without the reverse engineering efforts of certain people.
Thanks to [CD-i Fan](https://www.cdiemu.org/) for the insights into his closed source CD-i Emulator.
Also Thanks to MooglyGuy, which took on the task of implementing a CD-i emulator into MAME, which I used to analyse
the program flow of the CD-i boot process.

## FAQ, Issues and Quirks

The production quality of the CD-i hardware and the software running on it is sometimes questionable.
For this reason, I've created a small list of some known quirks, someone might suspect of being caused
by emulation errors but are also present on the real machine.

* Is the "Digital Video Cartridge" supported?
    * No! Please stop asking!
    * Potential development on the DVC might only start after everything works without bugs on the base machine.
* The map of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon" has micro jitter during scrolling
    * This also happens on real 210/05 hardware
* "Hotel Mario" seems to have the first samples of every ingame song repeated
    * You have good ears as it is barely noticeable. This also happens on real hardware.
* Some earlier CD-i titles have both stereo channels swapped
    * Yes, according to an [internal memo from Philips](http://icdia.co.uk/docs/mono2status.zip) there
      were manufacturing issues and some early players have the left and right channel swapped.
      This might explain discrepancies.
    * One known quirk is inverted stereo on the "Philips Logo Jingle" of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon"
* During the rotating transition in "Myst" there are glitched lines at the bottom
    * This also happens to some extent on a real 210/05 hardware and is caused by a misplaced Video IRQ
      The video data is changed while it is displayed.
* When I load a save game in "Burn:Cycle" it plays a short and unclean loop of noise until I do something
    * I thought that was a bug in the core at first too. However, it is actually like this on a real CD-i too.
* The music of Burn:Cycle sometimes has "pops" and "clicks"
    * This game is special. It doesn't play music from CD like most games for this system would do.
    * Small loops of sampled music are loaded from CD, stored in memory and randomly concatenated together
      to create the background music. These samples are sometimes not very "loopable" creating a pop at looping points.
    * This issue is reproducible on a real 210/05 as well      
* The music during the Philips Logo animation of Burn:Cycle has broken audio
    * This issue is reproducible on a real 210/05 as well
    * For some reason, it seems to be absent on other models with different hardware, like the 450/00
    * The problem can be fixed by overclocking the CPU
* Burn:Cycle - Random flickery animated text in front of the "Psychic Roulette" credit card terminal
    * This actually happens on the real machine. I also thought this might be a CPU speed issue, considering that
      the flickering disappears if the CPU is slightly overclocked.
* Flashback: The audio and video during the intro are asynchronous
    * This curiously happens on the real machine as well and doesn't even depend on 50 or 60 Hz
    * It seems to be an oversight by the developers when the game was ported to CD-i
* When dying in "Zelda's Adventure" the accompanying sound effect doesn't match the audio data on CD
    * Good catch! This is a programming error which can be reproduced on a real CD-i 210/05 as well,
      which causes the audio playback to start one sector too late.
    * The same phenomenon exists in the "Help cutscene" of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon"
        * It is not audible in that game, because of silence in the beginning
* The intro music of Zenith is played only on the left audio channel
  * Yes, this happens on a real 210/05 too. To be sure, I've tested it as well
    on a 450/00. It seems to be an oversight by the developers.
* During the cinematic intro of Kether, the screen flickers to black on some frames during the fading slideshows
  * This curiously happens on a real 210/05 too.
* If I mash the buttons really hard when booting up Tetris, I get a colorful glitched screen instead of the Philips Logo
  * Congratulations for this obscure finding. This happens on a real 210/05 too!
