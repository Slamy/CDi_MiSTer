# CDi_MiSTer

A project dedicated to create an FPGA implementation of the Philips CD-i to be usable for the MiSTer FPGA project.
As every Philips CD-i player has a different hardware, this project focuses on reverse engineering the "Mono I" PCB.
This mainboard is used in models like the 210/00, 210/05 or 220/20.

This repository is very experimental! Use at your own risk!

The first games are booting. Expect a certain amount of bugs!

## Usage

Place `cdi200.rom` as `boot0.rom` in `/media/fat/games/CD-i`.
Place `zx405042p__cdi_slave_2.0__b43t__zzmk9213.mc68hc705c8a_withtestrom.7206` as `boot1.rom` next to it.

The save files containing the NvRAM is compatible with the CD-i emulation of MAME.

Digital gamepads, Analog gamepads and mice are supported for use with this core.
To play a title, load a CD and press on the play button at the start screen.
CD images can be stored as CHD or CUE/BIN format.

## Status

Core Utilization:

    Logic utilization (in ALMs)  13,520 / 41,910 ( 32 % )
    Total registers              15626
    Total block memory bits      630,471 / 5,662,720 ( 11 % )
    Total DSP Blocks             66 / 112 ( 59 % )

### TODOs in order of priority

* Find a better solution for reducing CPU speed
* Fix regression: Audio hiccups during Philips Logo in Burn:Cycle
    * A workaround is CPU overclocking
* Investigate mysterious non loading behavior
* Investigate input responsiveness (skipped events?)
* Investigate screeching sound effect in the menu of "Golf Tips"
* Fix hang on audio track stop or change in media player
* Investigate "Gray border glitch" at the top of "Myst" gameplay (seems to be only one plane)
* Fix reset behaviour (Core is sometimes hanging after reset)
* Add auto start of titles using front panel "Play" button
* Find a way of detecting Audio CDs
* Investigate desaturated colors / low contrast in "Photo CD Sample Disc"
    * Probably fixable with 16-235 to 0-255 scaling
    * More investigation needed
* Find a solution for the video mode reset during system resets
    * The ST flag is the issue here, causing a video mode change
* Add SNAC support (IR remote + wired controller)
* Refurbish I2C for the front display and show the content as picture in picture during changes?
    * It might not even be required at all.

## Expected checksums of roms

This core is tested with these ROMs:

    2969341396aa61e0143dc2351aaa6ef6  cdi200.rom
    3d20cf7550f1b723158b42a1fd5bac62  zx405042p__cdi_slave_2.0__b43t__zzmk9213.mc68hc705c8a_withtestrom.7206

Due to legal reasons, these files must be sourced separately.

## Used resources

This MiSTer core would've probably never been possible without the reverse engineering efforts of certain people.
Thanks to [CD-i Fan](https://www.cdiemu.org/) for the insights into his closed source CD-i Emulator.
Also Thanks to MooglyGuy, which took on the task of implementing a CD-i emulator into MAME, which I used to analyse
the program flow of the CD-i boot process.

## FAQ, Issues and Quirks

The production quality of the CD-i hardware and the software running on it is sometimes questionable.
For this reason, I've created a small list of some known quirks, someone might suspect of being caused
by emulation errors but are also present on the real machine.

* Is the "Digital Video Cartridge" supported?
    * No! Please stop asking!
    * Potential development on the DVC might only start after everything works without bugs on the base machine.
* The map of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon" has micro jitter during scrolling
    * This also happens on real 210/05 hardware
* "Hotel Mario" seems to have the first samples of every ingame song repeated
    * You have good ears as it is barely noticeable. This also happens on real hardware.
* Some earlier CD-i titles have both stereo channels swapped
    * Yes, according to an [internal memo from Philips](http://icdia.co.uk/docs/mono2status.zip) there
      were manufacturing issues and some early players have the left and right channel swapped.
      This might explain discrepancies.
    * One known quirk is inverted stereo on the "Philips Logo Jingle" of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon"
* During the rotating transition in "Myst" there are glitched lines at the bottom
    * This also happens to some extent on a real 210/05 hardware and is caused by a misplaced Video IRQ
      The video data is changed while it is displayed.
* When I load a save game in "Burn:Cycle" it plays a short and unclean loop of noise until I do something
    * I thought that was a bug in the core at first too. However, it is actually like this on a real CD-i too.
* The music of Burn:Cycle sometimes has "pops" and "clicks"
    * This game is special. It doesn't play music from CD like most games for this system would do.
    * Small loops of sampled music are loaded from CD, stored in memory and randomly concatenated together
      to create the background music. These samples are sometimes not very "loopable" creating a pop at looping points.
    * This issue is reproducible on a real 210/05 as well      
* The music during the Philips Logo animation of Burn:Cycle has broken audio
    * This issue is reproducible on a real 210/05 as well
    * For some reason, it seems to be absent on other models with different hardware, like the 450/00
    * The problem can be fixed by overclocking the CPU
* Burn:Cycle - Random flickery animated text in front of the "Psychic Roulette" credit card terminal
    * This actually happens on the real machine. I also thought this might be a CPU speed issue, considering that
      the flickering disappears if the CPU is slightly overclocked.
* Flashback: The audio and video during the intro are asynchronous
    * This curiously happens on the real machine as well and doesn't even depend on 50 or 60 Hz
    * It seems to be an oversight by the developers when the game was ported to CD-i
* When dying in "Zelda's Adventure" the accompanying sound effect doesn't match the audio data on CD
    * Good catch! This is a programming error which can be reproduced on a real CD-i 210/05 as well,
      which causes the audio playback to start one sector too late.
    * The same phenomenon exists in the "Help cutscene" of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon"
        * It is not audible in that game, because of silence in the beginning
* The intro music of Zenith is played only on the left audio channel
  * Yes, this happens on a real 210/05 too. To be sure, I've tested it as well
    on a 450/00. It seems to be an oversight by the developers.
