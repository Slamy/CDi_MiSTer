# CDi_playground

A repo dedicated to create an FPGA implementation of the Philips CD-i to be usable for the MiSTer project

This repository is very experimental!

The current planned first milestone is having the boot rom usable
on the MiSTer.
It requires no CDIC to function.

## TODOs

* Fix "Error: system state exception; vector #$0010  at addr $00001500" during boot
	* Might be related to wrong on-chip auto-vectoring
* Implement ICA/DCA parser
* Implement CLUT7 RLE
* Implement functional video channel 1
* Interface to MiSTer framework
* Implementation of SDRAM controller
* Using MiSTer framework to load cdi200.rom and slave rom
* Attach MiSTer input system to the SLAVE controller
* Have the system menu usable on MiSTer
* Evaluate wrong answer on PAL/NTSC status from SLAVE
	* Right now, the expected answer 0x02 is inserted with glue logic
* Implement the CDIC audio parts
* Implement the CDIC CD parts
* Implement SPI interface to CD controller on SLAVE
* Fix I2C for the front display and show the display as picture in picture during changes?
	* It might not even be required at all.
* Have CD data available for the CDIC
* Use the MiSTer framework to save the NVRAM to sdcard
	* Only when changes are detected and when the OSD is opened
	* The N64 core does it like that to
